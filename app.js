/* Your tasks for part 1: ðŸ”» 
- ðŸ‘‰ Add request handlers/routes for your API that will handle requests to the path "/api/cats" for all the 
cats, providing the data in the cats array in this file. Test this in your browser.
- ðŸ‘‰ Add code to also handle requests for a cat by id using params, and cats by name using a query. 
Test this in your browser.
- ðŸ‘‰ Test the form on the front-end here: http://localhost:3000

  //browser executes main.js. Server is application running inside the terminal
});

app.use("/api/cats", router)
